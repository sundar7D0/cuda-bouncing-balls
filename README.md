# Accelerating 2D bouncing-balls game using CUDA DSL
To accelerate a 2D balls-collision game (designed initially in JavaScript, hosted online and was played 1000+ times), used CUDA (a design specific language to use Nvidia's GPU's as General Purpose GPUs) to accelerate it by 1.5Ã—. This speedup is achieved by leveraging:
* Pinned memory, texture buffer for a fast, dedicated buffer memory-space
* Read/write coalescing for fast data access
* Ternary operator to reduce thread divergence
* Stream kernels to exploit the parallelism in game-construct
* Atomically updated list for ball-states in each tile
* Cache-efficient nested for-loop
* nvprof profiler
* OpenGL for graphics

After reading, implementing few other techniques for accelerating this game-construct, "atomically updated list for ball-states in each tile" approach seemed to be the effective/optimal approach.

## Dependencies
1. [Installing CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html)
2. [Installing OpenGL](https://medium.com/geekculture/a-beginners-guide-to-setup-opengl-in-linux-debian-2bfe02ccd1e) 
3. C++ 11
4. Libraries: `cudart`, `glut`, `GLU`, `GL`, `GLEW`

## Using the code
Launch a single script for all needs: `final/final/main.cu`.
`nvcc final/final/main.cu final/final/Postprocess.cu -o main.out -I /usr/local/cuda-10.1/targets/x86_64-linux/include/ -lcudart -lglut -lGLU -lGL -lGLEW`
Postprocess helps in coloring the background of the game.
